# GoTBingo
A game of thrones bingo game designed by Zachary Johnson and Reynolds Aguilar.

Design goals:

1) web based 3x3 visual bingo board to be submitted by each subscriber with picture and name of characters from HBO's Game Of Thrones.

2) On the day of the first episode, each bingo board becomes visible to all other users.

3) Each week, the visual must be updated, shading red characters that die during that week's episode.

4) Display current ranking based on probability of winning by number of adjacent bingo matches.
